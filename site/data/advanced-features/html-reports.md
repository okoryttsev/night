## HTML reports

You can create HTML reports using [cucumber-html-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber-html-reporter)
As input you need to provide a Cucumber JSON report generated by this package. You have to run the report generation in a separate NodeJs process. For example if you are using NPM scripts and you execute the end-to-end test using `npm run e2e-test` then hookup the HTML report generation under `poste2e-test` NPM script. An example `package.json` could be the following.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "e2e-test": "nightwatch",
    "poste2e-test": "node create-html-report.js",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
